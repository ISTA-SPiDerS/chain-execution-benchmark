# Example benchmark

In the example benchmark we construct a block of size 'num_tx' that uses a smart contract that includes the combined functionality of all the workloads [here](../workloads).
First, it loads all the data structures from their respective files, constructs the distribution vectors and then creates a set of transactions to be submitted to the blockchain.
